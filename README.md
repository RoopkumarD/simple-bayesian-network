# Simple Bayesian Network Implementation

This is a Bayesian network implementation that allows you to create a Bayesian network and calculate probabilities.

Inspired by the [CS50 Bayesian Network Lecture](https://youtu.be/D8RRq3TbtHU?si=_T9po7cLNzOMTS4Z).

Please note that this probability engine is not intended for serious use; instead, this project represents my effort to implement concepts learned in a probability class.

## Usage

Refer to the `testing.py` file for examples on how to create nodes in the Bayesian network and calculate probabilities.
